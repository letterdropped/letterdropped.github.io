            <p>Hello, I am LetterDropped. I am a student and love computers and the internet. I'll be using this site like social media, where I'll upload my rants, reviews about things, and all that stuff people do on their social media. I got inspiration from bugswriter.com to become independent of the system.</p>

                <h2>Movies/Shows/Anime</h2>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Mr. Robot</li>
                    <li>Attack on Titan</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>I don't watch any anime/tv shows/movies, so this is what I got. These two are my favorite shows/anime which I have ever watched. I don't think so this list will upgrade. I am not planning to watch any movie in the future because it's a waste of my time.</p>

                    <li>Deep Work</li>
                    <li>The Alchemist</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>I have read many books, but those are self-help books, and I don't think they are my favorite. I was stupid to
                buy those books. I used to think that fiction books are sh*t, but after reading The Alchemist, my pov changed regarding the fiction books. Now I prefer history/fiction books.</p>
